# Diabetics-risk-prediction

## 📌 Project Overview

This project aims to predict diabetes risk using **Logistic Regression** in Python. The model is trained on a dataset containing various health indicators such as glucose levels, BMI, age, and other relevant factors. The goal is to help identify individuals at high risk of diabetes and promote early intervention.

## 🚀 Features

- Data preprocessing and feature engineering

- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) for insights

- Implementation of Logistic Regression for prediction

- Model evaluation using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score

- Interactive interface for user input and risk assessment (optional Streamlit integration)

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- **Programming Language:** Python
- 
- **Libraries Used:** Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn
- 
- **Framework (Optional):** Html and css

## 🔧 Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/diabetes-risk-prediction.git
   
   cd diabetes-risk-prediction

3. Create and activate a virtual environment:
   
   python -m venv venv
   
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
  
4. Install dependencies:
   
   pip install -r requirements.txt


## 📊 Usage

1. **Data Preparation:** Place your dataset in the `dataset/` folder.
  
2. **Model Training:** Run the training script:
   
   python src/model_training.py
   
3. **Make Predictions:** Use the trained model to predict diabetes risk:
   
   python src/prediction.py
   
4. **Run Streamlit UI (if implemented):**
   
   streamlit run app.py


## 📈 Model Performance

The model is evaluated using:

- Accuracy

- Precision, Recall, and F1-score

- Confusion Matrix and ROC Curve
